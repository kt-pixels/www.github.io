                                                It's important to note</b> that taking high doses of omega-3 supplements
                                                can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in people taking blood
                                                thinning medications. Therefore, it's important to talk to your
                                                healthcare provider before taking omega-3 supplements, especially if you
                                                have a bleeding disorder, are taking medications that affect blood
                                                clotting, or are scheduled for surgery. <br><br>
                                                <b>Omega-3 </b> supplements come in various forms, including fish oil
                                                capsules, liquid fish oil, krill oil, and vegan algae oil. The most
                                                common way to take omega-3 supplements is by swallowing capsules or
                                                liquid, but some people prefer to mix them into their food or drinks. If
                                                you have trouble swallowing pills, there are also chewable and gummy
                                                omega-3 supplements available. It's important to follow the recommended
                                                dosage on the supplement label and to store supplements in a cool, dry
                                                place away from sunlight.
