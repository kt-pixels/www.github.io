        Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in blood clotting and bone health. There are two main types of vitamin K: vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin K2 (menaquinone).
    </p>
    <h3>The benefits of vitamin K include:</h3>
    <li><b>Blood Clotting:</b> Vitamin K is necessary for the production of clotting factors in the blood, which helps to stop bleeding and promote healing after an injury.</li>
    <li><b>Bone Health:</b> Vitamin K is involved in the regulation of calcium, which is essential for strong bones. Adequate vitamin K intake can help reduce the risk of bone fractures and osteoporosis.</li>
    <li><b>Heart Health:</b> Some studies suggest that vitamin K may help reduce the risk of heart disease by preventing the calcification of arteries.</li>
    <li><b>Brain Function:</b> Vitamin K has been shown to support cognitive function and may help reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.</li>
    <li><b>Cancer Prevention:</b> Some studies have suggested that vitamin K may help reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, such as prostate and liver cancer.</li>

    <p class="impnote"><b>NOTE :- Good food sources of vitamin K include leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale, and broccoli, as well as liver, egg yolks, and fermented foods like natto. It's important to talk to your healthcare provider before taking vitamin K supplements, as excessive intake can interfere with blood thinning medications.
