                                            Tadasana promotes proper posture by aligning the spine, shoulders, and hips, reducing the risk of musculoskeletal imbalances.

                                            Tadasana cultivates stability and balance by grounding through the feet and finding a steady center of gravity.

However, having a non-slip yoga mat can provide comfort and stability. If you prefer extra support, you can use a folded blanket or yoga block to stand on to alleviate pressure on the feet or knees. Additionally, wearing comfortable clothing that allows for freedom of movement is recommended.

                                            Uttanasana deeply stretches the muscles in the back of the legs, including the hamstrings and calves, promoting flexibility and relieving tension.

                                            This pose allows the spine to lengthen and decompress, which can alleviate stiffness and discomfort in the back.

                                            Uttanasana has a calming effect on the nervous system, helping to reduce stress, anxiety, and mental fatigue.

                                            When you fold forward in Uttanasana, the head moves below the heart, which helps increase blood flow to the brain and promote circulation throughout the body.

                    It's important to listen to your body and practice with awareness. If you experience any discomfort or pain, modify the pose by lowering the intensity or reducing the range of motion.

                    Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a qualified yoga instructor before attempting any new poses, especially if you have any pre-existing injuries or conditions.

                   <b>Blanket :-</b> Use a blanket to provide extra cushioning or warmth if needed.

                   <b>Bolster or cushion :-</b> If you prefer additional support under your knees or lower back, you
                    can use a bolster or cushion.
                    <br><br>
                   <b>Eye pillow :-</b> An eye pillow can help block out light and promote relaxation in the eyes
                    and face.
                    <br><br>
                    Remember, Savasana is a time for complete relaxation and rejuvenation. Allow yourself to surrender to the pose, letting go of any tension or expectations. Enjoy this opportunity to rest and restore your body and mind.
